SAS Enterprise Guide If you have SAS Enterprise Guide software, which runs only under
Windows, you may choose to submit your programs from within SAS Enterprise Guide. To do this,
open a Program window where you can type in your SAS program or open an existing SAS
program. The progam editor in SAS Enterprise Guide (starting with version 4.3) displays automatic
syntax help as you type your program, and there is a program analyzer that will generate a
diagram of your program to help you visualize the parts and how they fit together. You can choose
to run your code on the local machine, or on a remote server where SAS is installed. To run your
SAS program on a remote server, you may need to have additional SAS software installed. Also,
SAS Enterprise Guide can write SAS code for you through its extensive menu system. SAS
Enterprise Guide is project based, so all your programs, results, and references to data are stored in
one project file. The following figure shows a project in SAS Enterprise Guide 4.3.
